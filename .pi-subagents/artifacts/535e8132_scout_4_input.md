# Task for scout

Explore the C++ side of /home/dotkrnl/tapa: tapacc/ (clang frontend + codegen), tapa-lib/, tapa-cpp/, tapa-system-include/. New language, no users, no backward compat needed. Identify: (1) compat shims/fallbacks (grep -i legacy|fallback|compat|deprecat|backward), e.g. tapacc/codegen/xilinx.cpp 'Mirrors the legacy' comment, disaggregated _s_* member ports; (2) dead code: unused headers/symlinks in tapa-system-include, stub decls, unused frontend helpers, superseded codegen paths; (3) duplication/missing single source of truth: port-naming rules, width conventions, task metadata formats duplicated between tapacc C++ and the Rust crates (name the specific duplicated conventions); (4) stale comments. For each: file:line, description, severity. Structured list, no fixes.

**Output:**
Write your findings to exactly this path: /home/dotkrnl/tapa/.pi-subagents/artifacts/outputs/535e8132/parallel-0/4-scout/context.md
This path is authoritative for this run.
Ignore any other output filename or output path mentioned elsewhere, including output destinations in the base agent prompt, system prompt, or task instructions.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
